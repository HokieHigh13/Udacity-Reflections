When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote respository if I was working on a group project. 
    Team members could not easily view my local repository and vice versa.
    Also, when working on a corporate project. Compan would have an easier
    time with the overhead.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
